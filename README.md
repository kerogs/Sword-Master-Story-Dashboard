<!-- IMPORTANT -->
# Important Announcement: Project Deprecation and Update

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Sword Master Story Dashboard is no longer functioning correctly, as the PHP script is unable to retrieve coupons from the website. Unfortunately, this means the service is currently unavailable. <br><br> However, I am working on a new version of the website (v2), which will be available in a separate repository. You can access the new project here: [SMSDv2](https://github.com/kerogs/SMSDv2). <br><br> Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your continued support!
