# Sword Master Story 3 Dashboard
The site doesn't store anything in a database, everything is in local files.

## 📖 About 
This site is called SMS3-Dashboard and is an improved version of a small project I had done for myself. I decided to improve the interface and add some features to make it more interesting, and I decided to share it if anyone would like to use the little site for themselves or on a server of their own.

I'd be grateful if you didn't delete the credits in my name on the site (they're not cumbersome), as this allows me to gain a bit of visibility.

## 🧐 What is SMS3-Dashboard ?
a web dashboard interface for retrieving all coupons from Sword Master Story.

The site is able to save the coupons you've already used, and will only display those you haven't (including coupons that will appear in the future).

The site updates automatically to retrieve the latest available coupons.

## ✒️ What can I do with the site?
I made the site for fun. You can deploy it wherever you want, I'm not responsible for what you do with it.

## 💬 How can I make a request or speak to someone?
If you'd like to make a request to add anything to it, you can do so directly from github or from [my discord server](https://discord.gg/2HGYSAjsWy).
